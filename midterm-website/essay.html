		<article class="a2">Like most things, Beauty standards change overtime; in the days before we had social media, beauty habits were dictated by ethnicity and the place lived in.  The influences were your surroundings, your parents, family, the town’s hot girl, and the furthest you can compare yourself to is the royal highness or the queen. In the late 1800s to early 1900s magazines became a thing, thus they were exposed to a new form of being influenced. However, it wasn't until the forties and fifties that Hollywood stars began appearing in magazines and on TV.  It was at that moment that celebrities in traditional media began to take over the ideal beauty standard.

		<article class="a3">Fast forward to the 2010’s, Social media became the main source and media we look at and get influenced by for beauty standards. That’s where the term “instagram models” was born. These “models” did not necessarily go on fashion runways or modelled clothes for a certain company. They can basically get ready at home, put the phone on the edge of the window and take a picture with the self timer and get thousands of likes and interactions. However, just like most other social media platforms, users can still get famous by doing something else, for example, photography, talking about tech, or any topic you are interested in.

		<article class="a4">Here where it gets scarier, starting off fall 2019 the chinese app TikTok users number have been and still skyrocketing where in one year it became the  sixth-most used social app in the world.  The way the app works is that the user has two main taps, the following page and the For you page. As named, the following page shows the user the videos from the people they follow; meanwhile the for you page shows the user videos generated by tiktok’s algorithm. Since the app uses its users' data to determine what to show them on their for you page , I believe it is more important than ever to know how this algorithm works. I recently  came across a brilliant video by the user @Benthamite who made a research looking into what’s called tiktok’s beauty score which is Tiktok’s supposed beauty algorithm. In his clip he proposes that Tiktok rates videos for potential success based on the attractiveness of those in it. He also suggests a paper by Xie Et al on developing an algorithm to assess human beauty. Algorithms to assess human beauty are nothing new. There are multiple from different Chinese universities all using the same dataset and building upon each other to produce more refined algorithms. For years, machine learning algorithms have been able to be trained by humans to differentiate between attractive and unattractive. </article>
